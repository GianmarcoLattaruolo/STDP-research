# STDP-research

## Summary


This repository contain the code for my Master Thesis with title "Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity Learning Techniques for Event-Based Signals".
My work focused on the Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rules which is a particular type of algorithm developed to be biologically plausible and mathematically tractable. Spiking Neural Netowrks (SNS) are the type machine learning architecture within we can test this algorithm. In this repository you can find a thourough analysis of both SNS and STDP, with implementation from scratch and subsequent exploitation of dedicated libraries such as SNNTorch. For mathematical proofs and techinical consideration you can ask me to provide you my thesis.
